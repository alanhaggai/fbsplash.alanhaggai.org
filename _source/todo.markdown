TODO List
---------

The list below includes some things that are planned for future versions of
fbsplash. The list should give you a rough idea of where the project is going.
It is however by no means exhaustive â€“ if your new cool idea isn't included
here, let us know by posting to our [mailing lists](mailing_lists.html). If you
want to help with the development of the project, have a look at the [get
involved](get_involved.html) page.

* Enhance the documentation
    * Manpages for all significant programs provided by splashutils
    * Tutorial about theme creation
* Develop unit tests for the config parser and the rendering engine
* Evaluate the possibility of using directfb as a backend
