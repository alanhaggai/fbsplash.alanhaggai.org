Mailing Lists
-------------

At the moment there exist two fbsplash-related mailing lists:
**fbsplash-users** and **fbsplash-devel**.

### fbsplash-devel@googlegroups.com

This is a list for people involved in the development of fbsplash. Send your
posts there if you want to help with the coding, documentation, porting to
other distros or if you think you encountered a bug.

[http://groups.google.com/group/fbsplash-devel/topics](http://groups.google.com/group/fbsplash-devel/topics)

### fbsplash-users@googlegroups.com

This is a list for all users of fbsplash. Post there if your issue is related
to fbsplash, but doesn't fall into the scope of fbsplash-devel.
