**fbsplash** (formerly gensplash) is a userspace implementation of a splash
screen for Linux systems. It provides a graphical environment during system
boot using the Linux framebuffer layer.

fbsplash follows a design policy of being simple, lightweight and fast. To
reduce bloat, it uses only a few most important libraries and does not require
X11. The code is optimized to have minimal impact on boot-up time.

fbsplash is distro-neutral and can in principle be used on any Linux system
which supports the framebuffer, but integration of fbsplash with the initscript
system requires writing customized code for different Linux distributions. A
reference implementation for [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/)'s baselayout-2 is
provided on this site.
