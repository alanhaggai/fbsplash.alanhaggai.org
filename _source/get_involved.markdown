Get Involved!
-------------

Whether you're an experienced coder, a skilled artist or just an ordinary user
who wants to help, there is always something useful that you can do to assist
the development of the project.

### For Coders

The code of all fbsplash scripts and utilities is maintained in a single GIT
repository. In order to start tweaking it, first create your own local copy:

    git clone git://github.com/alanhaggai/fbsplash.git

If you're not familiar with GIT, have a look at some
[tutorials](http://git-scm.com/documentation#tutorials).

Otherwise, just go to our [TODO](/todo.html) to get some idea of what needs to be done. Also
don't forget to subscribe to the fbsplash-devel mailing list!

You can also [browse](http://repo.or.cz/w/fbsplash.git) the fbsplash git repo.

### For Artists

Fbsplash would be useless without some great artwork.

### For Everyone Else

So, you can't code and you don't really have an artistic sense? Don't worry,
there's still a lot you can do to help!

Subscribe to the fbsplash-user [mailing list](/mailing_lists.html) and help new
users with their problems. Help us with our documentation efforts. Let us know
about your ideas for cool new features. Have a look at our TODO and see whether
it lists anything that you could help us with.

And, last but not least, join us on the official **fbsplash IRC channel** at #fbsplash
on irc.freenode.net!
